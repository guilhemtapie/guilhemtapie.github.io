# PokeathlonHub 
[![Status: Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-beta-orange)](https://github.com/yourusername/leaderboard) 
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.3.0--beta-blue)]()

PokeathlonHub is a simple leaderboard tracking website for the Pokeathlon, a famous HG/SS minigame.  
This is a beta version â€“ expect updates and improvements.

---

## How the Leaderboard is calculated
- Player statistics were manually pulled from all the public websites and forums I could find.
- In the record history of the course world records I used claimed only scores (unless they were too weird) until 2014 because 2014 is the year when people started actually attaching proofs for their scores.
- In the record history of the single events every type of score is used, but the top ones are always proven.
- In case of an equal score the tie-breaker rule was the date of the record.

---

## âš  Known Limitations
- **Real-time updates** are not yet implemented (static data only).
- **Incomplete stats**, if you have some data I do not have please share.
- The time tracking leadboard do not track time until today but it tracks until the last top 3 update.
